## The Hello World Moment Of Every Programmer


Hello world,
This is the first thing a programmer learns to write when he starts off a new programming language. To different people this simple "Hello World" means a whole lot of things. 

To some, (especially those that are really new to the tech world) it is the beginning of a new and exciting journey for them, they usually feel really accomplished and go about bragging that they know the programming language, some even go as far as putting it in their resume, their LinkedIn profile and even on their portfolio. Some find the steps after that confusing, yet they keep pushing till the end. Some of these people only ever understand this part of the learning process until after a while.

To some, (and now I mean people who are not really new to the tech world but just happen to be learning a different programming language) They compare how easy it is to print out the simple "Hello World" with another programming language that they have written before. They compare the similarities, the pros and the cons of the other languages they have written before and decide if they want to continue learning that programming language or not. Some of these people even skip the "Hello World" part of the learning process as it is not really mandatory

And to some others, (this time I am talking about people who start and never finish learning any programming language) these people have issues with consistency and they end up biting out of every apple and never ever end up finishing any. It might be the hundredth time they are coming back to the same programming language to learn all over from the beginning again and some might have deja vu while writing the code while others might have just forgotten that they have ever written that code before. Inconsistency is the issue that these people have.

Every programmer has been a member of either of these three categories, it all narrows to the ones who actually learn extensively, build projects and share source code, most of the successful software engineers out there were consistent after their first "Hello World", some may have not been consistent at first but then later down the line became consistent. 

Now my question for you who is starting out now is, "How consistent do you intend to be in your programming journey?"
