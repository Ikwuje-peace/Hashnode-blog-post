## Common Questions Rookie Developers Ask: 2

Hello, this is the continuation of the post I made earlier %[https://ikwujepeace.hashnode.dev/common-questions-rookie-developers-ask]. For this part of the series I will be answering the next two questions
•	What is UI/UX Design?
•	What programming language should I learn first?
**
UI/UX DESIGN**
UI Design in software engineering means User Interface. “UI design is the design of user interfaces for machines and software, such as computers, home appliances, mobile devices, and other electronic devices with the focus on maximizing usability and the user experience”…. Wikipedia……
I really like using relatable examples to buttress the answers I give to these questions. I will use a building plan as an example. The architect maps out the building plan either on paper or any understandable software they use, but the goal of that pencil plan is to give an abstract view of what the building should look like, the passageways, the bigger rooms and the smaller ones, the backyard and the balcony. Then this is given to the construction group and they follow the drawings to bring to reality the plan that was drawn. 
In this context they are called UI designers, they design the graphical interface of the software app or website or machine. And the designs they make are given to the front end developers for them to make this design a reality.  They UI designers are not programmers since they do not use codes to do their job instead the make use of graphic design packages like Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, Axure RP, etc. UI design is easier than front-end and back-end development. 

**UX** means User Experience." UX design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. This involves the design the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including the aspects of branding, design usability and function"....Wikipedia....
 UX design requires no coding. It’s an extremely varied discipline, combining aspects of psychology(in this context they try to think like the actual user of the software), business, market research, design, and technology. UX designers make sure the app or software being built is actually user friendly and easily understandable.A person can be both a UI and a UX designer too. What ever works for you is really fine.
**
WHAT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE SHOULD I LEARN FIRST?**

Well it depends on what you are interested in building, if you want to be a front-end developer you have to learn HTML/CSS and JavaScript for starters and when you are done with these you advance your learning scheme to Bootstrap, Sass, ReactJs etc.
If you want to be a back-end developer, well there are many programming languages used for back-end and some of which are PHP, Python, NodeJS, Ruby etc. But a piece of advice for those interested in back-end programming, try to know the basics of front-end developing too, because you might be working with these languages later in the future, and so you need to understand what each line of code is. 
If you want to learn python without any prior knowledge of the basics of front-end, it might be easy since Python is a programming language that is really simple to learn and understand, but at some point when you start using python frameworks like Django and Flask you might be need basic knowledge of HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
In other words I really suggest learning the first three basics before specializing in which ever stack you want to be focused on.
