## The Unmotivated Developer

It’s hard to feel motivated when you are running the race.

All the others are on their 3rd or 4th mile, enjoying the views, smiling and laughing, and you are still huffing and puffing,wondering if you’ll make it to the first mile marker.

Seems like everyone else has it figured out, and here you are….,you drive a beat-up car to work, you live paycheck to paycheck, you have a job you hate, and you feel burnt out.

Meanwhile others have; perfect LinkedIn posts, all the answers!, the job of their dreams, lots of money, and they travel a lot.

But here’s the thing, they all started off as beginners, they all have their stories.

Some may have had it easier, some may have had it worse.

What has made these people successful is their ability to stay the course.

Through the hardships, the struggles, they got up everyday and kept at it, pounding the pavement.

And now it’s your turn to do the same, get up everyday, and pound the pavement.

Run your race slowly, but steadily, picking up tips along the way to up your game.

Keeping your focus on the finish line, knowing that each step, each breath takes you closer to becoming the person that you were meant to be.

Keep going my friends, you have a lot to gain, and frankly, I don’t want to see you defeated.

I believe in you! I’m here to support you.

Where there is no pain, There is also no gain.
