## The Unmotivated Developer

It’s hard to feel motivated when you are running the race 🏃🏿‍♀️🏃🏃‍♂️

All the others are on their 3rd or 4th mile
Enjoying the views, smiling and laughing

And you are still huffing and puffing
Wondering if you’ll make it to the first mile marker

Seems like everyone else has it figured out

And here you are….
♦️You drive a beat-up car to work
♦️You live paycheck to paycheck
♦️You have a job you hate
♦️ And you feel burnt out

Meanwhile others have:
🔹 Perfect LinkedIn posts
🔹 All the answers!
🔹 The job of their dreams
🔹 Lots of Money
🔹 And they travel a lot

But here’s the thing 📝
They all started off as beginners,
They all have our stories

Some may have had it easier,
Some may have had it worse

What has made these people successful,
Is their ability to stay the course 🧭

Through the hardships,
The struggles 🙍

They got up everyday and kept at it
Pounding the pavement 👟👟👟

And now it’s your turn
to do the same,
get up everyday
and pound the pavement

Run your race
slowly,
but steadily 🐢🐢🐢

Picking up tips along the way
to up your game 🏈

Keeping your focus on the finish line,
Knowing that each step, each breath
takes you closer
to becoming that person
that you were meant to be ⭐️🌟💫

Keep going, my friends, you have a lot to gain
And frankly, I don’t want to see you defeated

I believe in you! I’m here to support you 💙

Where there is no pain, There is also no gain
