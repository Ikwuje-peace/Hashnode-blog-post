# 5 motivating things about being in tech


Sometimes, it is hard to do things when nothing is motivating you to do them. Other times, we are not consistent nor are we inspired to continue being in the tech field. This circumstance is because we don’t know what we could be gaining in the tech field, and we just focus on the hard part of our jobs as techies. Here are five reasons why you should stay motivated as a techie.
## 1. A degree is not compulsory.

You don’t need a degree to get it right here. I have heard testimonies from a lot of successful people in the tech field, and 70% of the people sharing these testimonies do not have a tech-related degree. Most of them took online courses and went for boot camps that were barely for six months and they got good at what they did.

Although, it would be an advantage to have a degree. There might be some job placements that you might be aiming for, and the job descriptions might require you to have a degree, but most of the time, they do not specify if it should be a tech-related degree. Any degree would do as far as you are good at your job and you produce impressive results.

You can take courses online that certify you in your field, and some of these certificates are recognized by most tech companies. It could be a substitute for a tech degree. This applies when you have a degree(not tech related) and you want to be certified in your tech field of specialty.
## 2. Tech is the future.

Research has shown that many jobs will go extinct by 2050 and their tasks will be handled efficiently by machines and robots. It is not news that tech is the future. Being part of the future, we need to be more inclined in the present to adjust to the future.

Tech jobs are not going extinct any time soon and this is motivating and assuring that your future is covered when you are involved in tech. Choosing a career path, especially in our Gen Z generation can be confusing, as jobs that were regarded as top-rated are now going extinct.

Take the banking sector for example. We no longer need to make contact with bankers to get our money or deposit money in the bank, we have ATMs, and we make transfers with our smartphones too. The economy is going cashless, and we might not need front-desk bankers in the nearest future.
No cash, Go Digital

However, the people in the IT department of the bank might not lose their jobs, for the obvious reason that they will be required to build more machines to regulate the inflow and outflow of cash. Some of them who are data scientists will be required to monitor, and make predictions on the changes that might happen in the nearest future, and what they are to do to curb them(if the changes will be bad), or fuel them(if the changes will be good).
## 3. The feeling of Fulfillment.

Happiness is the real sense of fulfillment that comes from hard work.

There is a feeling of fulfillment you get when you build things that are used to solve problems. You will be proud of yourself, knowing that you were among the people who built something, that other people use to meet different needs. You will feel needed, as you can develop solutions to various manual problems we still have in the world.

The creators of various social media platforms have solved multiple problems. They have made an impact in the world, and it is likely for them to feel fulfilled and happy with themselves. Social media aids in easy marketing for brands and connecting individuals. It also serves as a means for communication and easy dispersion of news.

When you are in the tech field, you may build new things, create new concepts or invent machines that automate what was once done manually. You are likely to be part of the people changing the world through technology.
## 4. Tech pays

The top 10 highest-paying jobs in the world are all tech related. The tech industry has a lot of revenue and there’s enough to go around for everyone. Working in tech, you can be assured that your bills will be covered. Although this happens when you are consistently growing, building things, or rendering services that will get you paid.

According to Glassdoor(Glassdoor is one of the fastest growing jobs and recruiting sites), as an entry-level front-end developer, you can expect to make $97,377 per year. The estimated total pay for a UI\UX Designer is $80,836 per year in the United States area, with an average salary of $75,132 per year. The average base pay for a back-end developer is $80,713, calculated from 200 salaries submitted anonymously to Glassdoor. The lowest salary submitted was around $48K, while the highest was about $132K.

Seeing these different statistics, it is agreeable that Tech pays. There are different research results online about different fields in tech, and how much they earn even for the entry levels of those positions. The better you get at your job, the higher your value, and the higher you earn. This is also a motivating fact.
## 5. Tech is broad

There are different fields in technology that you can always choose from and also migrate to. You can be a front-end developer and still be a technical writer; you can be a full-stack developer and decide to be a Software product manager afterward. You can move from being a front-end developer to being a UI designer.

The good thing about this is that, even if you do not want to write codes or build machines, you can still be relevant in tech, you can be a Data Analyst, Project Manager, Technical Writer, Social Media Manager, S.E.O Specialist, etc. These jobs pay well and are in high demand in the labor market.
####  . 
So whenever you feel like giving up, remembering these five points can encourage you to stay on track. These things and more makes it motivating to be in tech, and overlook the hard parts of your job. You can build things that will make you relevant in the tech industry as the years go by. Knowing that tech is the future should drive you not to give up, and to look at the bright side of things. You can take different paths in tech depending on your interests and strength. A degree is not compulsory and you can learn through online courses. You can earn even when you learn, and you earn well too.
